# GitHub Repository Description

## Short Description (for GitHub repo settings)

**Process Hiding Rootkit - Educational Kernel Module**

A Linux kernel module demonstrating advanced syscall hooking using ftrace to hide processes from system utilities. Educational project for learning kernel-level process manipulation and security concepts.

---

## Long Description (for About section)

### Process Hiding Rootkit

An educational Linux kernel module project that demonstrates:

- **Ftrace-based syscall hooking** to intercept system calls
- **Process hiding** from `ps`, `top`, and `/proc` enumeration
- **PCB (Process Control Block) manipulation** for scheduling control
- **Kernel module development** with modern kernel compatibility (5.7+)
- **Systemd service integration** for deployment scenarios

### Components

1. **Kernel Module** (`hide_process.c`) - Intercepts getdents/getdents64 syscalls
2. **User Program** (`programme.c`) - Manages process creation and priorities
3. **Deploy Script** (`bash.sh`) - Automated installation with dependency management

### Key Features

✅ Signal 64-based activation mechanism  
✅ X86-64 ftrace hooking implementation  
✅ Kernel 5.7+ compatibility with dynamic symbol resolution  
✅ Automated multi-distro dependency installation  
✅ PCB monitoring and display  
✅ Systemd service persistence  

### Educational Value

Learn about:
- Linux kernel module programming
- Ftrace function hooking
- Process management internals
- Privilege levels and CPU protection
- System call interception techniques

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Educational and research purposes only.** Unauthorized system access is illegal. Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
